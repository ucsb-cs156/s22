This is an **individual** lab on the topic of deploying
Java web apps that use OAuth and Databases, using Heroku.

You may cooperate with one or more pair partners from your team to help in debugging and understanding the lab, but each person should complete the lab separately for themselves.

# Preliminaries

We assume that you already created a Heroku account for `jpa02`.

We also assume that you are familiar with the material in `jpa02`
concerning the following items; consult jpa02 if you find
while doing the lab that you need a refresher on any of these:

* Running a Spring Boot app on localhost on port 8080
* Connecting to a server on `localhost:8080` and dealing
  with the issues that arise if that server is running on CSIL
* Creating a new app on Heroku
* Connecting an app on Heroku to a GitHub repo, and deploying
  a branch of that repo on Heroku

Also, if you are working on your own machine, you need the same
software that was needed for `jpa02`, namely:

* Java 17
* Maven
* git
* Heroku CLI

Since this is our first time working with frontend React code, you'll also need to setup the following:

* Node 14
* npm 8.3

See guides for installing these on your machine at the links shown:

* Windows / WSL / Ubuntu: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/windows_wsl/>
* MacOS: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/macos/>

# Step 1: Understanding what we are trying to do

## What are we trying to accomplish in this lab?

This lab, similar to `jpa02` has no programming; just like
 `jpa02` the task is simply to deploy an app on localhost
 and on Heroku.  This time, however, instead of a simple
`Hello World` type app, the app you are deploying is a full-stack
web app with:

* A front-end built in React (under the directory `./frontend`)
* A back-end built in Spring Boot (the code for this is under the directory `./src`, plus the `pom.xml` at the top level
* OAuth integration; this allows the app to have a "login/logout" feature based on Google Accounts (e.g. your UCSB Google Account)
* A SQL database, which runs using H2 (an in-memory database) on localhost, and using Postgres when running on Heroku.

The reason we are doing this lab is that before you can
work on a full-stack legacy code webapp, you need to know how to 
deploy such an app, i.e. get it running.

There are quite a few configuration steps that are needed,
and we want to get you used to those before we start
introducing the coding challenges as well.

# Step 2: Create your repo

You should already have a repo under the course organization 
<tt>{{page.github_org}}</tt> called 
<tt>{{page.num}}-<i>githubid</i></tt>
created for you by the staff, where <tt><i>github</i></tt> 
is your github id.

If not, create one for yourself following that naming convention;
it should initially be private, and empty (no `README`, license or
`.gitignore`.)

Clone that repo somewhere and cd into it.


Then add this remote:

<tt>git remote add starter {{page.starter}}</tt>

That sets up `starter` as a remote with the code from this github repo: <{{page.starter}}>

Then do:

```
git checkout -b main
git pull starter main
git push origin main
```

# Step 3: Configure your app as documented in the README.md

The next step is to read through the [README.md]({{page.starter}}/blob/main/README.md)
and configure your app as indicated there.

This includes configuration for Auth0, and GitHub Actions
(the `CODECOV_TOKEN`).

The configuration step includes copying the `.env.SAMPLE` file to `.env`.

The `.env` file  should *not* be committed to GitHub. 

The instruction to configure this app for OAuth are linked to from
the `README.md` in the starter repo itself, so will not repeat
them here.  Follow those instructions (which may, in turn, refer
you to instruction inside the `docs` folder of the repo.)

These instructions include setting up OAuth using your UCSB Google Account. 

## The `.env` file  should *not* be committed to GitHub

I already made this point, but I really, really want to emphasize it.

One of the values in the `.env` file is called a client *secret* for a reason.  

If it leaks, it can be used for nefarious purposes to compromise the security of your account; so don't let it leak!

Never, ever, commit those to GitHub, and try to only share them in DMs on Slack (not in public channels).

The same is true with Personal Access Tokens from GitHub (only more so!)   

Security starts with making smart choices about how to handle credentials and tokens. The stakes get higher when you start being trusted with credentials and tokens at an employer, so learning how to handle these with care now is a part of developing good developer habits.

The staff reserve the right to deduct points if we find that you have committed your `.env` file to GitHub.

## About OAuth

OAuth is a protocol that allows you to delegate the login/logout
functionality (user authentication) to a third party such as
Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, etc.  If you've ever used
a website that allows you to "Login with Google" or "Login With Facebook", then chances are good that app was built using OAuth.

Indeed, you've already encountered two examples of GitHub OAuth earlier in the course:
* when you used your GitHub account to log into the <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com>
* when you used your GitHub account to log into <https://codecov.io>

## Follow the instructions in the README

The instructions in the README include instructions
for deploying to both localhost, and to Heroku.  Follow those
instructions, consulting the material below and the
material in jpa02 as needed, until you have the application
working on both localhost and Heroku.

You'll be following this sequence of instructions many
times during this course, so this assignment is here to help you get used to that process.

## Also set up the GitHub Actions secrets

In the file `docs/github-actions.md` there are instructions for configuring
GitHub Actions so that it runs the tests for both the JavaScript and Java code in the repo.

You should follow these instructions to get the CI/CD pipeline set up so that
you have a green check, and not a red X, on the main branch of your repo.

## Reminder about running your web app on `localhost`

To get this demo app running on `localhost`, we need to do the following:

* Do the OAuth Configuration steps linked to from the README to get a client-id and client-secret
  and put them in your `.env` file
* Add your own UCSB email address after `phtcon@ucsb.edu`, and your mentor's email (see <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/info/teams/>) separated by commas (no spaces) like this:
  
  ```
  ADMIN_EMAILS=phtcon@ucsb.edu,mentorsemail@ucsb.edu,youremail@ucsb.edu
  ```
  
* Then, use `mvn compile` to make sure that the code compiles.
* Next, try `mvn test` to be sure that the test cases pass.
* Then, run the following two commands separately in their own shells
  * In the first, launch the React frontend using `npm start` in the frontend directory. This should start the frontend on port 3000
  * In the second, launch the Spring Boot backend using `mvn spring-boot:run`.  This should start a web server on port 8080

The `mvn spring-boot:run` command is a shortcut that is provided for us to be able to run the jar file.  It does pretty much the same thing as 
if we ran the `.jar` file and specified the class containing our `main` on the command line.

When the app is up and running, try logging in with your UCSB Google Account.  

# Step 4: Create a new Heroku App using the Heroku CLI

In this step, we'll deploy our Spring Boot application to the public internet using Heroku.

As part of the setup instructions, you likely already set up a Heroku application
with the name <tt>{{page.num}}-<i>ucsbnetid</i></tt>.

You should now be able to link this app to your repo and deploy the `main` branch,
provided you did all the other setup steps correctly.

# What if it doesn't work?

If it doesn't work, consult the troubleshooting steps in `jpa02` and try them before asking a mentor, TA, or instructor for help.

# Step 5: Set up Storybook repos

Storybook is a utility that produces documentation sites for React Apps.

We are going to set up two separate repos that have the same name as your repo, but with the suffixes `-docs` and `-docs-qa`.

For example, if your GitHub id is `cgaucho`, you'll have a main repo:

* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho</tt>

In this step, you'll create two additional repos:

* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho-docs</tt>
* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho-docs-qa</tt>

There is a script that you can try to run that should create these for you; the script is in the form of a "GitHub Action".

If the script works, great! (As of this writing, it was not working properly.) 

If not, you can create these two repos manually.

Instructions are under the `docs` directory in the file `storybook.md`.  Follow those instructions.

One step that isn't in the instructions:
* After you create the `-docs` and `-docs-qa` repos, you will need to click to create a `README.md` in order to
  establish the `main` branch, before you run the Github Actions scripts to populate the repos.
  
  Here's what that looks like:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/163060649-11b29e92-878f-4b3e-95d0-1d464d3450f6.png)
  
  Click where it says `README` to create a `README.md` file; *then* run the scripts.



When you are finished, update the links in the README.md file so that they point to your storybook repos:

Before:

```
* Production: <https://ucsb-cs156-s22.github.io/demo-spring-react-example-docs/storybook>
* QA:  <https://ucsb-cs156-s22.github.io/demo-spring-react-example-docs-qa/storybook>
```

After (with your URLs)

```
* Production: <https://ucsb-cs156-s22.github.io/jpa03-cgaucho-docs/>
* QA:  <https://ucsb-cs156-s22.github.io/jpa03-cgaucho-docs-qa/>
```

Make sure that the links work.

# Step 6: Submitting your work for grading

When you have a running web app, visit <{{page.gauchospace_url}}> and make a submission.

In the text area, enter something like this, substituting your repo name and your Heroku app name:

<div style="font-family:monospace;">
repo name: https://github.com/{{page.org}}/{{page.num}}-chrislee123<br><br>
on heroku: https://{{page.num}}-chrislee123.herokuapp.com<br>
</div>

Then, **and this is super important**, please make both of those URLs **clickable urls**.

The instructions for doing so are here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/gauchospace_clickable_urls/>


# Grading Rubric:

* (20 pts) Basic Logistics
  - Having a repo with the correct name in the correct organization with the starter code for this lab
  - There is a post on Gauchospace that has the correct content
  - The links on Gauchospace are clickable links (to make it easier to test your app)
  - README has a link to your repo.
* (20 pts) Having a running web app at <tt>https://{{page.num}}-<i>ucsbnetid</i>.herokuapp.com</tt>
* (20 pts) Running web app has the ability to login with OAuth through a Google Account.
